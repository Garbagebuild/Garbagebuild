SC490 Jethro Firmware!  This does not inlcude the userdata.img.  I do not reccomend full flash.
# üì± SC490 Dumbphone Firmware Dump & Notes
Firmware is here > https://drive.google.com/file/d/15glP9zp6oW5zboZGmp7MAclDeX0Bp9Oh/view?usp=sharing

This repository contains a firmware dump and technical notes for the SC490 flip phone. This device runs a MediaTek chipset and is commonly sold under the Jethro brand. The dump was created using **`mtkclient`**, not SP Flash Tool.

## üö® Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT attempt a full flash** unless you know what you're doing. The firmware is incomplete and doing a full flash may **soft-brick** your device (plus why you do that lol I havent modified anything).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **`userdata.img` is missing** from this repository but will be added soon.
- ‚úÖ Use **`mtkclient`** for all operations ‚Äî **not SP Flash Tool**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This firmware is for exploration, development, and recovery purposes only. Use at your own risk.

## üì¶ Notable Files Included

| Filename      | Description                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `preloader.bin` | MediaTek preloader required for boot          |
| `boot.img`    | Boot partition containing kernel & ramdisk       |
| `lk.img`      | Little Kernel (bootloader)                      |
| `system.img`  | System partition with OS & applications         |
| `MT6739_Android_scatter.txt`  | Partition layout for dumping and flashing         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Boot Behavior and Partition Notes

- `boot.img` contains a `default.prop` that **points to another file closely named the same prop.default inside `system.img\etc\`**. That second file controls the actual runtime properties like `ro.debuggable`, `ro.adb.secure`, etc.

## üîß Flashing

Use [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient) to interact with the device.
SP Flash Tool works with flashing but I had problems dumping the data with this tool, let me know if its just me or if SP Tool doesnt work right by Emailing me at samjo2010.s@gmail.com
