## ‚öôÔ∏è Boot Behavior and Partition Notes

- `boot.img` contains a `default.prop` that **points to another file closely named the same, prop.default inside `system.img\etc\`**. That second file controls the actual runtime properties like `ro.debuggable`, `ro.adb.secure`, etc.

## üîß Flashing

Use [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient) to interact with the devices fimware, or use fastboot.
